<h2>Creating a recommendation</h2>
<p><p>When you create a recommendation, you may have an idea of what you would like to recommend. Although this is a good starting point, be sure to read a variety of recent, timely research - not just research that supports your opinion. Articles that summarize a wide variety of research are okay to get a sense of the problem.</p><p>Once you've read a few articles from both sides, consider how the situation applies to BU and then write your recommendation. You may want to take note of the articles that swayed you, which will help in the Supporting Research section below.</p><p><strong>​Tips for Googling</strong><span class="redactor-invisible-space">​</span><br /></p><ul><li>​<span>Try describing </span><span>the</span><span> problem and adding usability or UX to the end: "</span><span>crosslink in navigation research usability</span><span class="redactor-invisible-space">​"</span><br /></li><li><span class="redactor-invisible-space">Try looking for general patterns or situations where the problem might occur.

<label>Our Recommendation</label>
<div><p>
    Do not autoplay videos on page load.
</p></div>
<label>What this means and why it's important</label>
<div><p>
    Users should have control over the content they want to access on a site. If a video is included on a site, make sure users have another way of obtaining the same information presented in the video.
</p></div>
<label>Other ways to solve this problem</label>
<div><p>
    When a video is autoplayed on Facebook, the video begins to play without audio, and is captioned. This is a great way to give a user a first impression of the video's content. If the content grabs a user's attention, he can then decide to unmute the video.
</p></div>
<h2>Supporting Research - Guidelines</h2>
<p><p>Once you've decided on a recommendation, you should back that recommendation up with up to three supporting sources below.</p><p>Look for research from trusted sources, such as Adobe, Nielsen Norman Group, and others first. <span class="redactor-invisible-space">​You should also look for the timeliness of the research - was it run within the past 2-3 years? Web usability is always changing, so use your best judgement. An older piece of research from a trusted source may not be the best option if user behavior patterns have shifted significantly in the past few years.</span></p><p><span class="redactor-invisible-space">Summaries of others' research, such as the ones you probably read to figure out your recommendation, are also okay here. But use ones that refer to actual user research, and only include the article that best summarizes the situation.crosslink in navigation research<span class="redactor-invisible-space">​</span></span></p></p>

<h2>Should this be researched further?</h2>
<p><p>​At this point, you should have a good idea of whether or not you're confident in your recommendation and how it applies to BU websites. If you're not confident - because you found research that makes you doubt other research you've read, or can think of an exception that isn't addressed in the research you've done - this is the time to bring it up, and we'll consider it for future usability studies with BU faculty, staff, and students.</p></p>
